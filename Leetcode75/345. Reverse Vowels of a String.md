# Requirements 

Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"
 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consist of printable ASCII characters.

# Solution

## Intuition
The same logic as reversing an entire string applies. However, the vowels must be isolated.

## Approach
Find the first and last vowels one at a time and swap them. Ensuring that the pointers front and back pointers do not overlap.

## Complexity
### Time complexity
- s.split("") -> O(n)
- while (i < j) ensures that the pointers move towards each other
- while (i < j && !vowels.includes(string[i])) AND while (i < j && !vowels.includes(string[j])) ensure that the outer bounds are not exceeded.
- Ensures that each letter is only processed once.
- Therefore, O(n)
### Space complexity:
O(n) where n is the length of s

# Code

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var reverseVowels = function(s) {
    let string = s.split("");
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'];

    let i = 0;
    let j = string.length - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        // Find first vowel from the left
        while (i < j && !vowels.includes(string[i])) {
            i++;
        }
        // Find the first vowel from the right
        while (i < j && !vowels.includes(string[j])) {
            j--;
        }
        
        // swaps the vowels
        const temp = string[i];
        string[i] = string[j];
        string[j] = temp;
        i++;
        j--;
    }

    return string.join('');
};
